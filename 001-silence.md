# What Does Silence Teach Me That the World Cannot?

In silence, I meet myselfâ€”not as the world defines me, but as I am.  
The noise of the world builds identities; silence breaks them.  
When I sit with silence, I am not expected to perform. I am only expected to be.

Silence teaches me the truth that cannot be heard, only felt.
